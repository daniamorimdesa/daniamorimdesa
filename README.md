## 🎨✨ About Me

Hi! I'm **Daniela Amorim de Sá**, and I have a deep passion for **creating** — in all shapes, colors, and codes.

Whether I'm **painting**, editing videos or diving into **hardware and software development**, one thing remains the same:
I love building meaningful and magical things.

My curiosity led me from art to **engineering**, where I discovered the beauty of logic, systems, and **technology**. I’ve worked with **embedded systems**, **IoT**, and more recently, I’ve been exploring the world of **front-end development**, blending creativity and code to bring ideas to life. I believe that **creativity and technology** go hand in hand — and I’m always chasing the next exciting idea ✨
